This Python script is a straightforward implementation of a countdown timer.
It begins by importing the 'time' module, necessary for utilizing the 'sleep' function to pause execution.
Upon running, the user is prompted to input a duration in seconds.
The program then enters a 'while' loop, where it continuously updates and displays the remaining time in minutes and seconds format.
Each iteration of the loop decrements the remaining time by one second using 'time.sleep(1)'.
Once the timer reaches zero, the loop terminates, and the message "time completed!" is printed.
While this script serves as a functional countdown timer, it lacks robustness in handling non-integer inputs or negative values.
Incorporating error handling mechanisms would enhance its reliability and usability in various scenarios.
